## The majority of this code comes from "Machine Learning with R" by Brett Lantz from Packt Publishing.
## Learning to use arules package for the first time.
## Looks for association rules in grocery purchases

install.packages("arules")
groceries <- read.transactions("groceries.csv", sep = ",")

itemFrequencyPlot(groceries, support = 0.1)
itemFrequencyPlot(groceries, topN = 10)

#will return a set of 0 rules.
rules1 <- apriori(groceries)
#returns a set of 58421 rules
groceryrules <- apriori(groceries, parameter = list(support = 0.0006, confidence = 0.25, minlen = 2))
inspect(groceryrules[1:5])
# get 5 rules with highest lift values
inspect(sort(groceryrules, by = "lift")[1:5])

#how to find the rules that deal with berries
berryrules <- subset(groceryrules, items %in% "berries")

write(groceryrules, file="groceryrules.csv", sep = ",", quote = T, row.names=F)
